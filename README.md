# Classifying MRI images with or without Alzheimer's Disease

The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images. It contains a training and testing folder. For my project, I refactored the images into the following organization:


- AlzheimersDataset/Positive with all 3200 positive images named pos(i)
- AlzheimerdDataset/Negative with all 3200 negative images named neg(i)


This way I can do binary classification and create my own randomized training and testing sets.
